# Rust port of [nn.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nn.h)

Exercise for learning neural networks.

Based on tsoding's nn.h video series:

- Ep 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7da9anmnMs

I ported the C code from a previous, and simple version of the C library, which has a really simple basic neural network
implementation that's easy to understand. Here's a link to the branch: https://github.com/tsoding/nn.h/blob/009eb61a75f2bd3d8d59f72bb4e1fad363b08c4a/nn.h
